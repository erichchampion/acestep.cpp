// Explicit CPU thread count and compute-device selection for embedders (#19).
//
// An app calls ace_backend_configure() once, before its first model load, instead
// of relying on the GGML_BACKEND environment variable -- an app does not configure
// itself with getenv. The env var stays as a fallback for the CLIs: when nothing
// has been configured, backend init still honours GGML_BACKEND, then auto-picks
// the best device.
//
// All the setters below are setup-time only and unsynchronized: the engine reads
// this config (holding a reference to the device string) at the first model load,
// so set it before any generate/load call and never from another thread while one
// is running. It is set-once configuration, not a live control surface.
//
// This header is deliberately free of any ggml dependency so an embedder can
// include just it to configure the engine; backend.h reads the config. Like the
// rest of the engine's API it is C++ (not extern "C"): a Swift/Obj-C app calls it
// from its C++ or Objective-C++ bridge (the same shim it already needs for
// ace_synth_* etc.), not from Swift directly.

// The one config instance, shared across translation units that link into the
// same image: a function-local static inside an inline (external-linkage) function
// has one instance per linked image, so the app's ace_backend_configure() and the
// engine's backend init read the same object even in different TUs. acestep-core
// links statically (build-ios-libs.sh, the CMake STATIC lib), so that image is the
// whole app -- one instance. If the engine were ever built as a separate
// dylib/framework, this static could duplicate across the boundary; move it to a
// .cpp (one external definition) then.

//                      still bites when hardware_concurrency() reports 0.
// auto_threads is the caller's own auto default (the P-core count for GGML GEMM, all
