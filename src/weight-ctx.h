// weight-ctx.h: format-independent weight loading context for ggml backends
//
// Manages a ggml_context for weight tensors + their backend buffer.
// Used by gguf-weights.h for all model loaders.
//
// Usage:
//   WeightCtx wctx;
//   wctx_init(&wctx, n_tensors);
//   ggml_tensor * w = <loader>_load_tensor(&wctx, source, "name");
//   wctx_alloc(&wctx, backend);
//
// Loaders that copy straight out of a file mapping record where the bytes came
// from (wctx_push_file_copy in gguf-weights.h); wctx_alloc releases those staged
// pages as it copies (Apple: munmap, Linux: madvise), which is what keeps load-time
// page residency near one tensor instead of the whole file.

// this code does not use. Verified per vendored backend that the synchronous call
// consumes src before returning: CPU memcpy, Metal blit + semaphore wait (shared
// buffers are a memcpy), CUDA memcpyAsync + cudaStreamSynchronize, Vulkan write with
// waitForFences. The src is fully read when the call returns, and nothing reads a
// tensor's src again afterwards.
//
// Only whole pages fully inside BOTH [src, src+nbytes) and the file mapping are
// released: start rounds up and end rounds down, so a page shared with an adjacent
// (possibly not-yet-copied) tensor survives, and a src not contained in the mapping --
// a heap staging buffer (adapter merge, the f32 and pre-permute loaders) or a stack
// scalar -- is skipped outright. The containment test is unreachable for correctly
// recorded copies (wctx_push_file_copy records in-mapping sources, and wctx_alloc
